# `cs_monero_flutter_libs`

A wrapper for platform-specific implementations of the binaries required to use 
the [`cs_monero` package](https://pub.dev/packages/cs_monero).  Refer to the 
main monorepo at https://github.com/cypherstack/cs_monero for more context.

## Optional

This package and its platform-specific binary bundle children are not required 
for `cs_monero` usage, but they are provided as a quick and convenient way to 
start coding with the library.  Refer to `cs_monero`'s documentation for more 
information on building the libraries from source.  Use this package (and 
especially its platform-specific children) as a template or example for bundling 
the required binaries.
